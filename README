                                      GETTING SPIM SOURCE
                                      ===================

Spim is hosted on SourceForge and its source code is available through SVN:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/


                                          DIRECTORIES
                                          ===========

The subdirectories can be divided into two categories.

1. Common to all versions of Spim:

    CPU -- Contains the MIPS simulator and some utility functions common to all version of the
           simulator.

    Documentation -- Contains the man pages, web page, and other documentation.

    bin -- Utilities.

    Setup -- Contain tools used to build deployable versions of the simulators.

    Tests -- Contains regression test for the simulator.


2. Front-ends for different versions of Spim:

    PCSpim -- Microsoft Windows front end for Spim. [Obsolete]

    QtSpim -- Front end for Spim that works on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

    spim -- Text-only (terminal or console) front end for Spim. Works on all platforms.

    xspim -- X-Windows front end for Spim. Works on Linux and Mac OS X. (Built on a very old
             X Windows library that is no longer supported by the Mac.) [Obsolete]


                                        BUILDING QTSPIM
                                        ===============

It is generally not necessary to build QtSpim as the Spim website contains an installable
version for most systems.

Install the bison parser generator and flex lexer generator, either using Cygwin on
Windows or native version on Linux and OS X.

1. Download the free (open source) version of Qt Creator from http://qt.io. This is a
large download that might take a while.  I have been using version 5.5, though any of the
version 5.x should work fine. The 4.x releases will cause problems because of incompatible
changes to the libraries.

        The open source version of Qt Creator for Windows, which uses mingw, works fine,
        as does the version that uses Microsoft Visual Studio's C++ compiler.

        The Qt Creator package for Ubuntu is typically several releases behind, which can
        cause some problems with QtSPIM.  Download a recent version from http://qt.io.

2. Start QtCreator and configure the project to use whichever compilers are available on
your system. gcc, llvm, and mdvc all work, though some of them generate some warnings at
high optimization levels (yes, I should fix them).

3. Build QtSpim.

        If you are porting to a new system and see a large number of compiler errors in
        QtCreator, changes are good that you need to change QtSpim.pro to define the
        compiler flag that says "treat all files, including .c files, as C++ code. This
        flag is "-X C++" for gcc and "-TP" for the Microsoft compiler.

4. Packaging QtSpim for distribution is a complex, OS-specific operation. The Setup
directory contains the files for all three platforms.

	On OS X, you need to run the script bin/release-osx and use the free Packages tool
	(http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html).

	On Windows,you need a copy of Visual Studio and the free version of InstallShield.

	On Linux, the script bin/release-debian handles the entire process.

On all three systems, the packaged version of QtSpim includes all of the libraries and
plugins used by QtSpim and assistant (the Qt help file viewer). Previously, the Linux used
dependencies to bring in other packages that contained these libraries, but I cannot find
the packages that contain all of these files for Qt5, so it is easier just to redistribute
everything.


                                    BUILDING SPIM and XSPIM
                                    =======================

It is necessary to build spim and xspim, as they are only distributed as source.

   1. Download the source for spimsimulator from sourceforge
   (https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/), either through Subversion from the
   spimsimulator repository (http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net) or
   by downloading the source code (https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files).

   2. Decompress the file, using either the program uncompress for the first file or gzip for
      the second file:

          % uncompress spim.tar.Z

      or

          % gzip -d spim.tar.gz

   3. Move the file spim.tar to the directory in which you want to build spim and untar it:

          % tar xf spim.tar

      It will create a directory named spim-8.0 (or the most recent version number).

   4. The simple terminal interface is contained in the spim-8.0/spim directory and the
   X-windows interfaces is in the spim-8.0/xspim directory. The other directories are described
   in the README file.

   5. Next, you must set the directories in which spim will be installed by editing the Makefile
   (the file that contains instructions on building spim). In general, if you are installing
   spim and want the windowing version (xspim), edit the file xspim/Imakefile. If you don't want
   xspim or are running on a system without X-windows installed, you use the file spim/Makefile.

      The programs are installed in standard locations, but you can change the pathnames to other locations:

          EXCEPTION_DIR -- The full pathname of the directory in which to install the spim exception handler (exceptions.s).

          BIN_DIR -- The full pathname of the directory in which spim and xspim should be installed.

          MAN_DIR -- The full pathname of the directory in which the manual pages for spim and xspim should be installed.

      In general, the remaining parameters in a Makefile need not be changed.

   6. Then, if you are building xspim, change to the spim-8.0/xspim directory and type:

          % xmkmf
          % make

      If you do not have a copy of xmkmf, you can use the Makefile in the xspim directory, but
      beware that it may not work on your system because the paths to the X windows libraries
      could be different.

   7. If you do not have X-windows, change to thespim-8.0/spim directory, edit Makefile, and type:

          % make

   8. To run spim or xspim, the exception handler must be installed in the directory specified
   by the variable EXCEPTION_DIR in the Makefile. If the file exception.s is not installed, spim
   and xspim fail before they start running. You can either install this file by hand or by
   typing:

          % make install

   which also installs spim or xspim, and the manual pages in the directories that you set
   (above). You may need root permission to install these files, in which case type:

          % sudo make install

   9. To test that spim is correctly built, change to the spim-8.0/spim directory and type:

          % make test

      and examine the output of the test. (Note: the exception handler must be installed before
      running the test.)


                                        BUILDING PCSPIM
                                        ===============

It is not necessary to compile PCSpim (the Microsoft Windows version), as the Spim web site
contains a precompiled version.

The Microsoft Windows version of Spim is called PCSpim and is built using Microsoft Visual
Studio.

spim (the terminal version) works well on Microsoft Windows.  You can easily build it using the
Cygwin port of the GNU tools (see www.cygwin.com).



                                      NEW VERSIONS OF SPIM
                                      ===================

I generally release new version of SPIM once a year, before a semester boundary (late August or
early January).  The new version are available on:

        https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/
