<em>Spim</em> is a self-contained simulator that runs MIPS32 programs. It reads and executes assembly language programs written for this processor. <em>Spim</em> also provides a simple debugger and minimal set of operating system services. <i>Spim</i> does <span class="ul">not</span> execute binary (compiled) programs.
</p>
<p>
<em>Spim</em> implements almost the entire MIPS32 assembler-extended instruction set. (It omits most floating point comparisons and rounding modes and the memory system page tables.) The MIPS architecture has several variants that differ in various ways (e.g., the MIPS64 architecture supports 64-bit integers and addresses), which means that <em>Spim</em> will not run programs for all MIPS processors.
</p>
<p>
<em>Spim</em> comes with complete source code and documentation.
</p>
<p>
<em>Spim</em> implements both a terminal and windows interfaces. On Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X, the <em>spim</em> program offers a simple terminal interface and the <i>QtSpim</i> program provides the windowing interface. The <a href="older.html">older programs <em>xspim</em> and <em>PCSpim</em></a> provide native window interfaces for these systems as well.

<h2><a name="qtspim">QtSpim</a></h2>
<p>The newest version of <em>Spim</em> is called <i>QtSpim</i>, and unlike all of the other version, it runs on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, <span class="ul">and</span> Linux&#8212;the same source code and the same user interface on all three platforms! <i>QtSpim</i> is the version of <em>Spim</em> that currently being actively maintaned. The other versions are still available, but are no longer maintained or updated.
</p>
<p>
A compiled, immediately installable version of <i>QtSpim</i> is available for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux can be downloaded from: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/"> https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/</a>. <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/spimsimulator/code/HEAD/tree/">Full source code</a> is also available (to compile <i>QtSpim</i>, you need <a href="http://qt-project.org/downloads">the Qt framework</a>, a very nice cross-platform UI framework that can be downloaded from <a href="http://qt-project.org/downloads">http://qt-project.org/downloads</a>).
