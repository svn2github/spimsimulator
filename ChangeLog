2005-07-25    <Jim@LS1>

        * CPU/sym-tbl.c (resolve_a_label_sub) [Vegdahl, Steven vegdahl@up.edu]:
        Did not add 1 to upper 16 bits of LW/SW pair (to compensate for
        signed add in instruction) when there was an ADDU instruction
        between the LUI and LW/SW, due to an indexed address compuation.

2005-06-04    <Jim@LS1>

        * spim/spim.c (console_to_program) [Peter Fröhlich phf@cs.ucr.edu]:

        debbiep@csse.monash.edu.au]:
        Use termios(3) library calls instead of IOCTLs to fix bug
        introduced in port from termio to termios struct (did not change
        TCGETA -> TCGETS and TCSETA -> TCSETS, since the latter does not
        exist in Cygwin).

        * Tests/tt.core.s (jalr_):
        Test default case for jalr, without default $rd (=31).

        * Tests/tt.io.s blair bethwaite [blair.bethwaite@gmail.com]:
        Trap handle in test extracted wrong bits from ExcCode field of
        Cause register.

2005-05-31    <Jim@LS1>

        * Pervasive restructuring of files to put 3 UIs (spim, xspim,

        that smashed it.

        * PCSpimView.{cpp,h}

2004-11-27    <Jim@LS1>

        * mem.c inst.h (check_memory_mapped_IO) [Deborah debbiep@csse.monash.edu.au]:
        Clearing the transmitter or receiver interrupt enable bits also
        clear interrupt pending bits in Cause register. Transmitter and
        receiver interrupt enable bits now operate properly (ie prevent
        interrupts when cleared).

2004-11-26    <Jim@LS1>

        * xspim.c (console_input_available) [Daniel Stearns dstearns@csc.calpoly.edu]:
        Code to poll for a console input character in X windows blocked and
        prevented any output until input occured.

        Correct typos in comments

2004-11-13    <Jim@LS1>

        * op.h [lau@det.ua.pt]:
        Type of "mul" instruction was wrong, which lead to it being
        printed without destination register.

2004-10-19    <Jim@LS1>

        * inst.c (inst_decode):
        Do not printf with format string from user input (comment).

2004-10-18    <Jim@LS1>

        * inst.c (format_an_inst):
        Do not print breakpoint instruction. Instead, print underlying instruction.

        Table had same opcode for beq and beql, which caused unparing
        error that unparsed beq as beql.

2004-09-26    <Jim@LS1>

        * spim.c, Configure:
        Eliminated dependence on obsolete termio.h in favor of posix

        Fix null pointer problem if no entries in registry.

        * spim-utils.c [J.P. Mellor [jpmellor@rose-hulman.edu]]:
        Turn off EXL bit after break instruction, since break is handled by
        SPIM, not MIPS, code and the bit was never getting cleared.

        * Move to VC7.0 (Visual Studio.NET).

2004-09-12    <larus@HomeMachine>

        * Released SPIM 7.0b (on Windows) to propagate changes.

        * Tests/tt.core.s:
        Test for SQRT.S used double constant, which failed on SPARC (but
        not x86).

2004-08-22    <larus@HomeMachine>

        * Released SPIM 7.0a to propagate changes.

2004-03-28    <larus@HomeMachine>

        * run.c:
        Changed CP0 timer to poll on Unix, since signals interrupt system
        calls and affect SPIM's I/O.

2004-03-25    <larus@HomeMachine>

        * display-utils.c, xspim.c windows.c:
        Made X interfaces a bit more compact and regular. Works on a
        1024x768 screen.

        * inst.c inst.h parser.y run.c:
        Fix internal representation of instructions by separating FS from
        RS field and moving it RD and RD to SHAMT.

        to ISO C strings.

        tt.io.s:
        Fixed implementation of console IO.
        Ensure that interrupts occur before instruction execution (and
        other exceptions afterwards), so that EPC points to instruciton to
        restart.

2004-03-11    <larus@HomeMachine>

        * mips-syscall.{c,h} spim-sycall.h syscall.{c,h}

        * prevasive:
        Implemented MIPS32 instruction set.
        Eliminated coprocessor 3.
        Made coprocessor 2 operations raise coprocessor unimplemented trap
        (CpU).
        Modified exceptions and interrupts to conform to MIPS32 (ex when
        compiled -DMIPS1).
        Added CP0 timer.
        Fixed trap.handler to work with MIPS32 exceptions.

2004-02-19    <larus@HomeMachine>

        * inst.c inst.h spim-utils.c:
        Sorted instruction tables in advance, rather than on first use.

        Updated documentation to reflect changes to command line options
        and new syscalls.

        * pervasive:
        Eliminated #ifdef __STDC__. Everyone must have a non-K&R compiler
        by now.

        * mem.c [Akim Demaille (akim@epita.fr)]:
        Word align all segments, in particular, ensure that sbrk returns
        word-aligned addresses.

        Correctly implement delayed load instructions. (Nobody ever use
        them before?)

        * parser.y:
        Record labels on line with syntax error.

        * scanner.l [P. Augustyniak silvathraec@rpg.pl]:

        Removed the -traditional-cpp flag from MacOSX. (It appears that
        the semantics of this flag have changed and now break spim.)

        * Configure Imakefile Makefile.cygwin Makefile.std Tests/tt.le.s
        Tests/tt.be.s Tests/tt.core.s Tests/tt.core.OK Tests/tt.endian.OK:

        * mips-syscall.c cl-cache.c cl-cycle.c cl-except.c cl-cache.h
        cl-expect.h
        Change from Scott Rosenberg:

there were some problems with the signal handling because somehow an
old (and incorrect version) of gun's signal stuff was merged with mine.
fixes to both cl-spim and spim code can be found in cl-except.[ch] and
mips-syscall.c.  the errors came about due to incorrect management of
spim's pseudo memory which resulted in seg violations.

i also fixed a one line problem in mips-syscall.c in old spim code so
that return values on exit when running an assembly file in cycle mode
would match values expected by cl-spim.  (i hadn't tested this until
someone sent me mail).

i updated cl-cache.[ch] so that it could print the write back buffer.

        Added conversion so that reads and writes of instructions work
        correctly in the text and data segments.  This means that programs
        can manipulate instructions as data and execute out of the data
        segment.  Also fixed bug in jumps to addresses with high bits set
        (ie in data segment). [Suggestion from Eliot Moss.]

        * mem.c spim-utils.c spim.c spim.h xspim.c spim.tex
